Articulation Points Calculation in Unoriented Graph
This program implements an algorithm to calculate the articulation points (also known as cut vertices) in an unoriented graph. Articulation points are vertices in a graph whose removal increases the number of connected components. The program utilizes Depth-First Search (DFS) to find these points in the graph. If a graph is disconnected, the program will notify the user.
